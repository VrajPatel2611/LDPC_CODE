##  Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) Codes for 5G New Radio (NR). 
LDPC codes are forward error correction codes used in modern digital communication systems to achieve data rates close to Shannon capacity.

We built and simulated:
- LDPC encoding using base graphs (BG1 and BG2)
- Rate matching and puncturing
- BPSK modulation over AWGN channel
- Hard and soft decision decoding using Min-Sum algorithm
- Performance evaluation using BER and success probability


##  Algorithms & Techniques

- LDPC Encoding (5G NR Base Graph)
- Rate Matching and Code Rate Control
- BPSK Modulation over AWGN
- Hard and Soft Decision Decoding
- Min-Sum Algorithm
- Tanner Graph-Based Iterative Decoding
